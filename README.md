## Project Description:

	Floodlight is an Open Source SDN Controller, compatible to be used by 
	Mininet, an Open Source Virtual Network Emulator. OVSSwitch provides the 
	necessary toolset for Switching functionality in SDN to Mininet. Since 
	the emergence of Netoworking as a functionality for connecting People 
	across the world, we have only observed patented standards for configuration 
	of networks by some of the most prestigious companies in the networking 
	industry, namely Cisco & Juniper. For instance, Cisco uses IOS as the underlying 
	OS for almost all of the hardwares that it's built so far. It has pre-defined 
	RFC Standards for R&S which means, we can't alter the algorithms they use, 
	or make out-of-the-box changes to adapt to our envisioned network requirements. 
	For ages, we have seen network administrators going on sacrificing and compromising 
	optimalitity in their networks with sub-optimal and fixed solutions of these 
	companies. However, with the emergence of SDN, we have near to Full Control over our 
	network's working, using the same backbone architectures that we've been 
	using but with added functionality of customizability. In our case, OVSSwitch 
	& Floodlight together do that job for R&D Purpose. 
	With a simple Multicast Routing Algorithm implemented over fundamental SDN 
	implementation, we are trying to test the feasability of the network by using 
	Video Streaming as the sole application. Why Video Streaming? It involves 
	Realtime sampling & packeting, QoS specifications, Realtime Media Controlling 
	functionality and most importantly, can't afford large packet losses. All of these
	can be provided by RTP (W/ RTCP) which is an application layer protocol using 
	UDP as the underlying payload container, made solely for Realtime Communications 
	(Audio/Visual). It supports Multi-party Communications & Conferences as well. 
	Applications made over this protocol, also have the provisioning for Error 
	Prevention 	& Concealment, alongside Timestamping and Sequencing, which together 
	helps in smooth playback irrespective of adverse network conditions like 
	Broadcast Noise. In our case, we are using FFmpeg's inbuild functionality for 
	RTP (PT96) Streaming & Recording over Multicast Network. In the background, we have 
	initiated a simple 'Broadcast Noise' contributed by the hosts in the network, to 
	deploy scalable traffic in the network. QoS implementation by Mininet on the other 
	hand, helps in balancing out this traffic. By analyzing the frames & the packets, 
	we are able to produce mapping of sent and receive quality in SDN. By applying that 
	over Multicast Networks, we are able to test the susceptibility of the network in 
	Multicasting Environments.

## Previously Used/Tested Software Packages/Scripts (See: old/):

	1. LibVLC (from VideoLAN â€“ Native VLC Player Library)
		This library has no video processing/post-processing logging and control. 
		Also, the binary is produced as a single package without any customizability 
		or addon feature.
	2. Vlcj Java API
		This API is not VideoLAN proprietary and so, isnâ€™t suitable for R&D purpose.
	3. Apache Ant, Maven with Maven Ant Tasks
		Use of Maven Ant Tasks is depricated. This was one of the reasons, why we planned 
		to remove Java as dependency from Mininetâ€™s script. Note: Floodlight still requires 
		JDK with Apache Ant.
	4. NoiseUDP (C/Java), StreamVLC (Java), RecordVLC (Java), PlayVLC (Java)

## Noise Calculation Theory:

	Annotations:
		t = Delay b/w Packets (Milliseconds)
		P = Payload Size (Bytes)
		h = Header Size (Bytes) (Always Fixed)
		b = Data Rate (bps) (Given)
		MTU = Maximum Transmission Unit (Always Fixed)
	
	Objective:
		Minimize Z = (1000 / t) aka. Number of Packets transmitted per Second.
	
	Case 1: (Default)
		P is fixed,
			t = 8000 * (h + P) / b
		Optimal Solution: Use max(P) = MTU - h
		Note: This is only feasible if t <= 1000
	
	Case 2:
		t is fixed,
			P = (t * b / 8000) - h
		Optimal Solution: Use max(t) = 1000
		Note: This is only feasible if p <= MTU - h
